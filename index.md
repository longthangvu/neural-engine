# Neural Engine Documentation

This documentation site is a reorganized, Jekyll-based version of the excellent work by  
**hollance** on the [original GitHub repo](https://github.com/hollance/neural-engine).

All technical content belongs to the original author.  
This site simply provides a clean, searchable documentation interface.
